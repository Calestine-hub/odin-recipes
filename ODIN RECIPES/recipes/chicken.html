    <p>As a Kenyan, I love kienyeji chicken because of the natural intense flavour . If you are not from Kenya,
        kienyeji simply a free range chicken, one that hsd been rared on the farm and been let lose to roam around 
        and eat what mother nature has to offer, Thus the meat often tends to be tougher then broiler chicken but much
        more flavourful. The Ingridients that make this dish mainly Kenyan, are the kienyeji chicken of course, onions,
        tomatoes,dhania,chili,green hohos,royco.
    </p>
    <p>	For this recipes, I gave it a twist with the addition of other Ingridients as well as used mint 
        leaves because they give the dish a refreshing, vibrant taste. I also hope it inspires you to explore 
        different herbs, but please don't go 'kuku'( <em>crazy</em> ) if you cant find mint leaves just use what you have.
